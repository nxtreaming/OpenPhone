## 🎯 What is OpenPhone?

**The Problem**: Most AI agents rely on expensive cloud APIs and large models that are impractical for real-world on-device deployment. Users face **Privacy Concerns**, **Latency Issues**, and **High Costs** when their phone needs to call external services for every interaction.

**Our Solution**: OpenPhone introduces the first **Open-Source, 3B-parameter Agentic Foundation Model** designed specifically for on-device smartphone interaction. This compact vision-language model runs entirely locally — meaning **No Privacy Concerns**, **No Cloud Dependence**, and **Zero API Costs**.

**🤔 Why 3B Parameters?** <br>
We believe the future of mobile AI lies not only in making models larger, but in making them smarter and more efficient for real-world constraints. Our 3B model is:
- ⚡ **Edge-Optimized**: Efficient enough for commodity GPUs and next-generation mobile NPUs
- 🔒 **Privacy-First**: All computation stays on your device
- 💰 **Cost-Free**: No cloud inference and no ongoing API fees
- 🎯 **High-Performance**: Achieves performance comparable to 7B–9B models through advanced training techniques

---

## 💡 Research Highlights

### 🔍 OpenPhone‑3B: Lightweight Agentic Model
Considering the compute limitations of today’s edge devices, models with **≤3B parameters** strike a practical balance between capability and deployability. Based on this insight, we introduce **OpenPhone‑3B**, a lightweight yet powerful on‑device agent model.

- **Model Size & Architecture**: A ~3B‑parameter vision‑language model designed for efficient on‑device reasoning and action generation, optimized for performance under tight compute budgets.
- **On-Device First**: Built to serve as the primary agent running locally, with latency and memory usage compatible with single 3090‑class GPUs and upcoming mobile NPUs—avoiding the need for continuous cloud access.
- **GUI‑Aware Action Capabilities**: Trained to interpret visual inputs, follow instructions, and generate structured actions across mobile tasks, enabling practical end‑to‑end agent behaviors on real mobile devices.
- **Open‑Source Release**: We provide full model weights, configuration files, and an inference stack to support deployment, fine‑tuning, and further development by the community.
- **Practical Sweet Spot**: Under current hardware conditions, the 3B scale provides a **Highly Realistic Sweet Spot**—much stronger than tiny models, yet still deployable on edge devices where 7B–9B models are often too large or too slow.

### Why 3B is the Sweet Spot for Phone Agents
- **Hardware Constraints**: 3B parameters fit comfortably within the memory limits of high-end consumer GPUs (8-12GB) and align with the computational budgets of emerging mobile NPUs.
- **Latency Matters**: GUI interactions demand sub-second response times. Our benchmarks show 3B models achieve 3-5x faster inference than 7B alternatives while maintaining competitive accuracy.
- **Battery Efficiency**: Smaller models mean longer device usage - critical for mobile deployment where power consumption directly impacts user experience
- **Privacy-aware Architecture**: 3B enables the phone tasks to run entirely on-device, preserving user privacy and eliminating network dependencies.
- **Cost-Effective Operation**: By handling most tasks locally, OpenPhone eliminates expensive cloud model APIs and per-request charges.

## 🧪 Testing & Evaluation

### Single Task Testing
Test individual tasks using the following command structure:

```bash
python eval.py -n test_name -c your path to config.yaml --task_id task_id
```

Example Usage:

```bash
python eval.py -n all_cloud_v1_hyper -c ./configs/example_xml_cloud_hyper.yaml --task_id zoom_1
```

### Batch Evaluation Scripts
Convenient batch testing scripts are available in `./test_script`:

• `all_test_cloud_v1_hyper.sh`: Evaluates all 138 AndroidLab benchmark tasks<br>
• `all_test_cloud_v1_hyper_add.sh`: Evaluates tasks for four additional mobile apps<br>

### Additional App Documentation
For comprehensive details about the four additional app tasks, refer to the documentation: [Additional Apps Documentation](./docs/new_apps.md)

## 📊 Result Generation

### LLM Evaluator Setup
Required Configuration: Set up LLM service credentials in ./evaluation/tasks/llm_evaluator.py:

• Line 10: API configuration<br>
• Line 12: Service URL<br>

💡 Enhancement: Our implementation replaces AndroidLab's rule-based evaluation with LLM-powered assessment, providing more nuanced and accurate task completion evaluation.

### Generate Evaluation Results
Execute result generation with the following command:

```bash
python generate_result.py --input_folder ./logs/evaluation/ --output_folder ./logs/evaluation/ --output_excel ./logs/evaluation/test_name.xlsx
```
### Batch Testing File Management
⚠️ Important: When using batch scripts from ./test_script/:<br>
• Manual Transfer Required: Move generated evaluation files from script directory to ./logs/<br>
• Then Execute: Run the result generation command above<br>
• Error Prevention: This step prevents file path conflicts and ensures proper result compilation<br>

## 🎯 Evaluation Results

The key findings from our online evaluation on AndroidLab are summarized as follows:

- OpenPhone, when deployed in a device-cloud collaborative setting, incurs only a relatively small performance drop while effectively reducing the number of cloud model invocations.
- Notably, prompting large models for extended reasoning does not always yield better results—this benefit depends on the capability of the cloud model, and only sufficiently strong models can take advantage of such strategies.
- We also report a comparison between OpenPhone-3B and both similar-sized and larger models (such as 9B models), showing that OpenPhone-3B achieves performance close to that of 9B models, making it a true "small powerhouse."
- Furthermore, when compared with closed-source models, OpenPhone-3B's performance is comparable to previous or lightweight versions of these proprietary models.

</p>

For each MLLM, we measure the average total steps required to complete tasks, the proportion of steps handled by the on-device model versus the cloud model, and the average steps when using only the cloud model to quantify the reduction in cloud calls. The main results are as follows:

- The cloud model is still responsible for about 65% of the steps, mainly due to the limited capacity of the smaller on-device model.
- Introducing the on-device model leads to approximately a 10% reduction in cloud calls.
- Stronger cloud models (such as GLM-4.5V) experience a smaller reduction in cloud calls, as they are capable of solving more tasks independently without relying on the on-device model.

  <img src="./figures/device_cloud_reduce.png" width="47%"/>
</p>

We evaluate the average inference time per step using vLLM under different GPU setups. GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking could not run on a single 3090 GPU due to context length limits, so only two-GPU results are shown.

OpenPhone, thanks to its lightweight architecture, demonstrates a clear advantage in inference speed, making it more suitable for real-world on-device scenarios. This advantage becomes even more pronounced as computational resources become constrained. In contrast, although GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking achieves higher performance, its inference time on two 3090s is 3.5 times that of OpenPhone on a single 3090, and 4 times that of OpenPhone on two 3090s. Its inability to run on a single 3090 further limits its feasibility for on-device deployment.
